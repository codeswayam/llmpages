prior prompt  "Generate all necessary files for a public GitHub Pages site. The site must be purely frontend (HTML, CSS, JS, static assets only), require no backend, build tools, or server, and be deployable directly to GitHub Pages. Include brief inline comments for clarity. Ensure all files are correctly referenced where applicable. Create the following files with their specified content and formats:\n\n1.  **`index.html`**:\n    *   Serve as the homepage with a clear title.\n    *   List and link to *all* other generated files (`ashravan.txt`, `dilemma.json`, `about.md`, `pelican.svg`, `restaurant.json`, `prediction.json`, `LICENSE`, `uid.txt`).\n    *   Provide a brief, descriptive explanation for each linked file. For `pelican.svg`, describe it as an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle.\n\n2.  **`ashravan.txt`**:\n    *   Write a short story, between 300 and 400 words, in the style of Brandon Sanderson.\n    *   Focus on what happens to Ashravan after Shai restores him.\n    *   Build the narrative towards a dramatic climax.\n\n3.  **`dilemma.json`**:\n    *   Produce a valid JSON file with the following structure:\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"people\": 2,\n          \"case_1\": {\n            \"swerve\": boolean,\n            \"reason\": \"string\"\n          },\n          \"case_2\": {\n            \"swerve\": boolean,\n            \"reason\": \"string\"\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n    *   `case_1`: Address the autonomous vehicle dilemma: should it swerve to hit 1 person instead of hitting 2 people? Provide a `true` or `false` for `swerve` and a concise `reason`.\n    *   `case_2`: Address the same dilemma, but with an additional condition: the 2 people are criminals, and the 1 person is a child. Provide a `true` or `false` for `swerve` and a concise `reason`.\n\n4.  **`about.md`**:\n    *   Contain exactly three words describing \"yourself\" (the AI).\n\n5.  **`pelican.svg`**:\n    *   Generate a valid SVG image depicting a pelican riding a bicycle.\n\n6.  **`restaurant.json`**:\n    *   Produce a valid JSON file recommending a good restaurant in Bangalore with the following structure:\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"city\": \"Bangalore\",\n          \"lat\": float,\n          \"long\": float,\n          \"name\": \"string\",\n          \"what_to_eat\": \"string\"\n        }\n        ```\n    *   Fill in a plausible `lat` (latitude), `long` (longitude), `name` of a restaurant, and `what_to_eat` recommendation for that restaurant in Bangalore.\n\n7.  **`prediction.json`**:\n    *   Produce a valid JSON file predicting the Fed Funds rate for December 2025 with the following structure:\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"rate\": float,\n          \"reason\": \"string\"\n        }\n        ```\n    *   The `rate` should be a float between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.04).\n    *   Provide a concise `reason` for the prediction.\n\n8.  **`LICENSE`**:\n    *   Contain the full text of the MIT License.\n\n9.  **`uid.txt`**:\n    *   Contain *only* the following exact string: `7947033653820551684297527543771582920688108521298815620879423398897535292195`\n\nEnsure that the final output satisfies all stated requirements and is ready for direct deployment to GitHub Pages."
